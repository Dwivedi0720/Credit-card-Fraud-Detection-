# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Overview
Credit card fraud detection is the project of identifying and preventing unauthorized use of credit cards. This system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze transactions and detect fraudulent activities.

## Features
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies potentially fraudulent transactions based on patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses classification algorithms for high accuracy.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Detects fraud instantly on incoming transactions.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insights into fraudulent patterns.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python fraud_detection.py
   ```

## Usage
- Input transaction data for analysis.
- The model predicts if a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
- Review detected fraudulent activities in the visualization dashboard.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)**
- **Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)**
